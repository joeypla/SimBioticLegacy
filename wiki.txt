Scene
A scene is a finite space and its Entities. It can be a massive outdoor world, to a little house, to a gui to a 2d room. Scenes can be drawn to other scenes, and will be projected
if the parent scene's container is a lower dimension. An example of this would be having a 3d room scene and drawing another 3d scene onto a 2d surface like a tv screen. One
can also draw a 3d scene within a 3d space. This provides flexibility when wanting to have things divided into regions.

Entity
An Entity is anything that exists in a scene. This is very general. It need not even have a position. The idea behind this is so that ghost like behaviour (ie gamemode) can be
simulated this way. It is not the only option, but its available largely for this reason. Examples: Gamemode behaviour, custom script like behaviour, general music.
